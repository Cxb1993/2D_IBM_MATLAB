NOTE:

-The working simulations are:
    a. EXAMPLE_PARABOLIC_FLOW_IN_EMPTY_CHANNEL
    b. EXAMPLE_MIDDLE_CHANNEL_FLOW
    c. EXAMPLE_FLOW_AROUND_CYLINDER
    d. EXAMPLE_1_WALL_FLOW_AROUND_CYLINDER

-The following simulation parameters have not been optimized: EXAMPLE_TUBE_BLEBBING

-If visualizing VELOCITY VECTOR data in VisIT, you need to scale the vectors appropriately, 
    e.g., multiple orders of magnitude, since velocities are rather small.
